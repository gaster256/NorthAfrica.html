<p>Desalination plants are factories that take the salt out of seawater and put it into water bottles for drinking water or they put them in giant barrels for massive supplys of water. It solves the problem that not everyone can get enough water in the desert but it still doesn´t solve all of the water issues that take place in the desert. It solves someones thirst by making more water available for those who didn´t already have it. Desalination plants also make the water cheaper by lowering the demand of the water. This is going to make everyones live alot easier by making sure they don´t have to go three miles round trip every hour for water. Everyone wants these desalination plants because it makes life a lot better.</p>
